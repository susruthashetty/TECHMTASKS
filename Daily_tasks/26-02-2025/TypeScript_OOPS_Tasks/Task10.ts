//10. Write a TypeScript class called Person with properties name and age. Implement a constructor that initializes these properties when a Person object is created. Then, create a derived class Employee that extends Person. Override the constructor of the Employee class to include an additional property employeeId.

class Person77 {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}

class Employee extends Person77 {
  employeeId: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number, employeeId: number) {
    super(name, age);
    this.employeeId = employeeId;
  }
}

const employee1 = new Employee("Nithish", 20, 101);
console.log(employee1);
