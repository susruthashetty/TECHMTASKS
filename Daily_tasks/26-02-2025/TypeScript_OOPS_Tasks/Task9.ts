//9. Write a TypeScript class called Animal with properties name and species. Implement a constructor that initializes these properties when an Animal object is created. Next, create a derived class Tiger that extends Animal. Add a method roar() to the Tiger class that prints a message indicating that the tiger is roaring.

class Animal {
  name: string;
  species: string;

  constructor(name: string, species: string) {
    this.name = name;
    this.species = species;
  }
}

class Tiger extends Animal {
  roar() {
    console.log(`${this.name} the tiger is roaring!`);
  }
}

const myTiger = new Tiger("Sheru", "Bengal Tiger");
console.log(myTiger);

myTiger.roar();
