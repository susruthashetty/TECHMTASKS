//8. Write a TypeScript class called Student with properties name and age. Implement a constructor that initializes these properties when a Student object is created. Additionally, add validation to ensure that the age provided is a positive number. If the age is not positive, set it to a default value of 0.

class Student4 {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age > 0 ? age : 0;
  }
}

const student18 = new Student4("Nithish", 20);
const student25 = new Student4("Sam", -5);
console.log(student18);
console.log(student25);
