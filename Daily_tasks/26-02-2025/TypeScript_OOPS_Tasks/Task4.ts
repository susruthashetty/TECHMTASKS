//4. Write a TypeScript class that defines a base class Car with properties like make, model, and year, along with a start() method that prints a starting message. Now create a class called Engine with the properties horsepower and fuelType. Modify the Car class to include an instance of the Engine class as a property. Implement a method printCarDetails() in the Car class that prints both car and engine details.

class Engine {
  horsepower: number;
  fuelType: string;

  constructor(horsepower: number, fuelType: string) {
    this.horsepower = horsepower;
    this.fuelType = fuelType;
  }
}

class Car1 {
  make: string;
  model: string;
  year: number;
  engine: Engine;

  constructor(make: string, model: string, year: number, engine: Engine) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
    this.engine = engine;
  }

  start() {
    console.log(`The ${this.make} ${this.model} is starting.`);
  }

  printCarDetails() {
    console.log(
      `Car1: ${this.make} ${this.model}, Year: ${this.year}, Engine: ${this.engine.horsepower} HP, Fuel: ${this.engine.fuelType}`
    );
  }
}

const myEngine = new Engine(300, "Petrol");
const myCar = new Car1("Toyota", "Camry", 2023, myEngine);
myCar.start();
myCar.printCarDetails();
